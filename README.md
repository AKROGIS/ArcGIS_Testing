# ArcObjects Testing

This repo is a C# Visual Studio solution with a number of
projects (console apps) for testing various functionality
of esri's ArcObjects SDK for .Net.

The snippets probably do not represent best practices (I
don't grok COM).  They are handy as a launch pad
for testing out the many holes in the SDK documentation.
